## 🎨 Code style

* Follow **PEP8** (Python style guide).
* Keep functions small and focused.
* Write clear docstrings (Google or NumPy style).
* Use type hints where possible.
* Avoid duplicating code — refactor instead.

---

## 📝 Commit guidelines

* Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
* Format:

  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  ```

  Examples:

  * `fix(api): handle missing file extension in PDF upload`
  * `feat(frontend): add toggle for re-uploading PDFs`
  * `docs: expand README with API usage examples`

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.

---

## ✅ Testing

* Ensure all changes pass existing tests.
* Add new tests for new functionality.
* Run tests locally before pushing (using `pytest` or your chosen framework).
* Check that both FastAPI endpoints and Streamlit UI still run without errors.

## 💡 Tips for good contributions

* Small, focused PRs are easier to review than giant ones.

* Document new features in README if user-facing.
* Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` if dependencies change.
